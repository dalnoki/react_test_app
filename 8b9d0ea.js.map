You may use `\"Space\"` as an alias\nfor the `\" \"` name.\n\nModifiers can be given in any order. `Shift-` (or `s-`), `Alt-` (or\n`a-`), `Ctrl-` (or `c-` or `Control-`) and `Cmd-` (or `m-` or\n`Meta-`) are recognized. For characters that are created by holding\nshift, the `Shift-` prefix is implied, and should not be added\nexplicitly.\n\nYou can use `Mod-` as a shorthand for `Cmd-` on Mac and `Ctrl-` on\nother platforms.\n\nYou can add multiple keymap plugins to an editor.
